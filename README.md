# SupervisedLearningScorePrediction

This model predicts the Score of the student based on the hours of study per day.
Here I have also implemented the cut-off percentage marks and also predicted that will the student be able to pursue marks above the cut-off percentage or not

This model is made using 2 algorithms, one which is Kmeans and another in KNeighbors Classifier to classify that student will pass the cut-off percent or not.
